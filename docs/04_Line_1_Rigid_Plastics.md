# Line 1: Rigid Plastics Processing

## Purpose
Transforms approved plastic waste into durable tools, containers, and structural components for the Martian base.

## Approved Input Materials
- **PET** (Polyethylene Terephthalate) - water bottles, food containers
- **PP** (Polypropylene) - food packaging, laboratory equipment
- **PE** (Polyethylene) - bags, shrink wrap, containers

## Restricted Materials
- **NO PVC** (Polyvinyl Chloride) - releases toxic chlorine when heated
- **NO PS** (Polystyrene) - difficult to recycle, poor mechanical properties
- **NO halogenated plastics** - prevent toxic fume generation

## Processing Steps

### 1. Shredding Stage
- Approved plastic items are cut into small, uniform flakes
- Visual inspection to ensure only approved plastics enter system
- Magnetic separator removes any metal contaminants

### 2. Compression Stage  
- Plastic flakes are cold-pressed into dense bricks
- Mechanical pressure forms without heat
- Creates standardized raw material blocks

### 3. Forming Stage
- Plastic bricks are heated to 160-200Â°C until malleable
- Vacuum forming creates specific shapes
- Custom molds produce needed items

## AI Monitoring Systems
