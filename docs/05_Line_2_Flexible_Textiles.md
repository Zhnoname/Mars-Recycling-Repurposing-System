# Line 2: Flexible Textiles Processing

## Purpose
Transforms textile waste into filters, cleaning materials, and other flexible products for the Martian base.

## Input Materials
- Cotton clothing and fabrics
- Polyester textiles
- Mixed fabric waste
- Cleaning cloths and towels

## Processing Steps

### 1. Fiber Separation Stage
- Mechanical shredding of textiles into individual fibers
- Air classification to separate different fiber types
- Removal of non-textile components (buttons, zippers)

### 2. Slurry Preparation
- Mixing fibers with water and natural binders
- Creating homogeneous pulp mixture
- Consistency monitoring for optimal formation

### 3. Sheet Formation
- Wet laying process to form uniform sheets
- Water drainage and fiber mat formation
- Pressing to achieve desired thickness

### 4. Drying and Curing
- Low-temperature drying (60-80Â°C)
- Natural binder activation
- Final product conditioning

## AI Monitoring Systems
