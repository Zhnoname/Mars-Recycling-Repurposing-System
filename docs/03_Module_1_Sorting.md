# Module 1: Sorting Station

## Purpose
The Sorting Station is the entry point for all waste in the MRRS system. Its main goal is to separate mixed inorganic waste into distinct material streams for specialized processing.

## Design

### Physical Layout
- Central sorting table with multiple collection bins
- Color-coded containers for easy identification
- Protective equipment station for crew safety
- Integrated lighting and ventilation

### Color Coding System
- **BLUE** - Plastics (rigid packaging, containers)
- **GREEN** - Textiles (clothing, towels, fabrics)  
- **YELLOW** - Metals (structures, packaging, parts)
- **RED** - Hazardous Materials (batteries, chemicals)
- **GRAY** - Mixed/Composite Materials

## Operation

### Daily Procedure
1. Crew delivers daily waste to sorting station
2. Operator dons protective gloves and eyewear
3. Manual separation of items into appropriate bins
4. Quick visual inspection for contamination
5. Bin contents transferred to processing lines

### Safety Protocols
- Mandatory glove use during sorting
- Immediate isolation of sharp or dangerous items
- Regular surface cleaning and disinfection
- Emergency procedures for chemical spills

## Performance
- Processes daily waste accumulation
- Requires minimal energy input
- Enables efficient downstream processing
- Adaptable to changing waste composition

## Advantages
- Simple and reliable mechanical process
- Low training requirements for crew
- Flexible to handle unexpected waste items
- No complex machinery or software needed
