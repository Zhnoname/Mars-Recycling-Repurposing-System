# Module 1: Sorting Station

## Purpose
The Sorting Station is the entry point for all waste in the MRRS system. Its main goal is to separate mixed inorganic waste into distinct material streams for specialized processing.

## Design
### Physical Layout
- Central sorting table with multiple collection bins
- Color-coded containers for easy identification
- Protective equipment station for crew safety
- Integrated lighting and ventilation

### Color Coding System
- **BLUE** - Plastics (PET, PP, PE only)
- **GREEN** - Textiles (clothing, towels, fabrics)  
- **YELLOW** - Metals (structures, packaging, parts)
- **RED** - Hazardous Materials (batteries, chemicals, unknown plastics)
- **GRAY** - Mixed/Composite Materials

## Safety Systems
### Hazard Identification
- **Training**: Crew trained to recognize restricted plastics (PVC, PS)
- **Visual guides**: Reference images of approved vs restricted materials
- **Testing strips**: Chemical indicators for halogenated plastics

### Threat Mitigation
- **Sharp objects protocol**: Special handling for metal edges
- **Chemical spill kit**: Immediate containment of leaks
- **Emergency ventilation**: Activated for suspicious materials
- **Personal protection**: Gloves, goggles, masks mandatory

## Operation
### Daily Procedure
1. Safety equipment check
2. Visual inspection of waste stream
3. Sorting with hazard identification
4. Immediate isolation of dangerous items
5. Surface decontamination

## Performance
- Processes daily waste accumulation
- Prevents hazardous materials from entering processing lines
- Maintains crew safety through multiple protection layers
