# Module 0: Hazardous Materials Management

## Purpose
Safely handles and contains toxic, reactive, and dangerous materials that cannot be processed through standard recycling lines.

## Input Materials
- Batteries and power cells
- Chemical containers and reagents
- Medical and biological waste
- Unknown or contaminated materials
- Restricted plastics (PVC, PS, halogenated)

## Processing Steps

### 1. Identification and Sorting
- Visual inspection and hazard classification
- Barcode scanning of known materials
- Chemical testing for unknown substances
- Risk assessment and categorization

### 2. Neutralization and Treatment
- Chemical neutralization where possible
- Battery discharge and stabilization
- Biological waste sterilization
- Volume reduction through compaction

### 3. Secure Containment
- Double-walled stainless steel containers
- Leak-proof sealing systems
- Radiation shielding where needed
- Environmental isolation
