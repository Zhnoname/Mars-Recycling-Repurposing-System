# Problem Statement

## The Waste Challenge
A crew of 8 astronauts on a 3-year Mars mission will generate approximately 12,600 kg of inorganic waste. This includes:

- Packaging materials
- Worn-out clothing and textiles  
- Discarded equipment and structures
- Various plastic and metal items

## Current Limitations
- No option to send waste back to Earth
- Burning trash is not allowed due to safety risks
- Storage space on Mars missions is extremely limited
- Waste accumulation could create health and safety hazards

## NASA's Challenge Requirements
We addressed the NASA Space Apps challenge to design systems that can:
- Manage inorganic waste on Mars
- Reuse materials when possible
- Recycle waste into useful products
- Work with limited energy and water resources
