# MRRS (Mars Recycling and Repurposing System)
A practical waste management solution for Mars missions

## Project Description
Our team developed MRRS to address the waste management challenge for long-duration Mars missions. The system processes different types of inorganic waste through separate recycling streams to create useful products for the crew.

## System Overview
MRRS consists of four main components that work together:

### Sorting Station
Crew members sort waste into four categories:
- Plastics for rigid items
- Textiles for flexible materials  
- Metals for construction
- Mixed materials for processing

### Plastic Recycling Line
Process for plastic waste:
1. Shredding into small pieces
2. Cold pressing into bricks
3. Thermoforming into new shapes
4. Output: tools, containers, parts

### Textile Recycling Line  
Process for fabric waste:
1. Fiber separation
2. Mixing with water and binder
3. Sheet forming and drying
4. Output: filters, wipes, packaging

### Metal and Regolith Processing
Process for construction materials:
1. Metal shredding
2. Mixing with Mars soil
3. Geopolymerization
4. Output: building blocks, panels

## Estimated Performance
Based on our calculations:
- Processes approximately 11-12 kg of waste per day
- Uses about 10 kWh of energy daily
- Requires 60 minutes of crew time per day
- Recycles 90% of water in textile process

## Technical Approach
We focused on:
- Simple mechanical processes where possible
- Low-temperature operations for safety (not more than 250 C)
- Using local Mars materials (regolith)
- Minimal dependence on Earth supplies
